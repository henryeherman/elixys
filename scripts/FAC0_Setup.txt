FAC synthesis setup

1. Make sure cold trap is ready
2. Make sure gaskets are in place
3. Make sure cassettes are filled with reagents:
    (Cassette.Position = Reagent)
    1.1 = K222/MeCN
    1.2 = MeCN
    1.3 = MeCN
    1.4 = MeCN
    1.5 = MeCN
    1.6 = EtOAc
    1.7 = EtOAc
    1.8 = NaOMe
    1.9 = HCl
    1.10 = HPLCMP
    1.A = QMA
    1.B = Small silica Sep-pak
    2.1 = Toluene
    2.2 = Dichloromethane
    2.3 = Dichloromethane
    2.4 = Dichloromethane
    2.B = Large silica Sep-pak
4. The following will be added manually and should be prepared when needed:
    Precursor1
    HBr/dichloroethane
    Precursor2
5. Make sure the vials with stir bars are in place
6. Make sure the dip tubes for transfer in cassettes 1 and 2 are in place
7. Draw fluoride and measure the starting activity
8. Make sure F-18 vial is install and ready for delivery
